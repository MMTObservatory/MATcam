Web interfaces and back-end infrastructure for MMTO camera systems.  These include the cameras used for the Mount Alignment
Telescope, the F/9 wavefront sensor, and the F/5 wavefront sensor.  The ultimate goal is to provide consistent, easily extensible
front and back end interfaces to all camera systems used at the MMTO.
